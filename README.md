# 6190-final
Final project for CS 6190, more updates to come

Currently, the project only has partially implemented sensors, you can test out these sensors by watching any Guilty Gear strive match while running the baseloop() function. Of course you would need to keep track of the variables in one way or the other (i.e. with a print statement added in). 

For example this video should cause the algorithm to start reading data correctly (note that the video file's pixels may be slightly distorted causing slightly incorrect values) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE6xdK2h5GU
